## 1. Career Counselling

### Evidence
- [Career assessment results](Thimna_Gogwana_Personality_Assessment.pdf)

### Reflection (STAR)
**Situation:** As part of my academic development in my final year of the Diploma in ICT, I completed a personality-based career assessment to better understand my strengths and how they align with potential career paths in the tech industry. 
**Task:** My objective was to gain clarity on my ideal ICT roles and identify how my personality traits could influence my future workplace performance. I wanted guidance on what environments and roles would suit me best.  
**Action:** I took a personality test (based on the 16Personalities/MBTI framework) and reviewed the results with the lens of career development. The test identified my personality type as INFJ, which emphasizes empathy, organization, and a strong desire to do meaningful work. I analyzed the results in relation to various ICT roles and created a radar chart to visualize my key traits.
**Result:** The assessment helped me discover that I am best suited for roles such as UX Designer, Business Analyst, and Software Testerâ€”positions that require both technical skill and human-centered thinking. It gave me direction on how to approach my career and helped me realize that I value purpose, structure, and ethical problem-solving in a workplace.
